# Interactive Front-End "Fix-It" Challenge

This is a hands-on, single-page learning environment designed to test and improve your core front-end skills in **DOM Manipulation** and **CSS Selectors**.

The application presents a webpage that is intentionally "broken"‚Äîit's unstyled, misaligned, and lacks interactivity. Your challenge is to solve a series of problems by writing real JavaScript code and CSS selectors directly on the page. With each correct solution, you will see the page visually transform in real-time, piece by piece, until it becomes a polished and complete design.

### üéì How to Use This Demo to Learn

This is not just a project to look at; it's a tool to actively use. Follow these steps to maximize your learning experience:

1.  **Open the `dom_practice.html` file** in your web browser.
2.  **Open the Developer Tools** by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (`Cmd+Option+I` on Mac). Keep the **Elements** and **Console** tabs handy.
3.  **Read the first problem card.** It will describe a visual issue and ask you to write a CSS selector or a line of JavaScript to fix it.
4.  **Write your solution** in the text area for that problem.
5.  **Click "Apply Fix".**
    *   **If you're correct,** you'll see a success message and a part of the page will visually change!
    *   **If you're incorrect,** you'll get a prompt to try again. This is where the real learning happens! Use the DevTools to inspect the elements, test your selectors in the console, and figure out why your first attempt didn't work.
6.  **Proceed through all the challenges** until the entire page is "fixed" and looks like a complete, styled webpage.

The goal is to bridge the gap between knowing a concept (like `document.querySelector`) and knowing how to apply it to a real-world problem.

### ‚ú® Skills Practiced

This single exercise covers a wide range of fundamental front-end topics:

**CSS Selectors:**
*   Selecting by ID (`#id`)
*   Selecting by Class (`.class`)
*   Selecting by Attribute (`[type='text']`)
*   Using Child Combinators (`>`)
*   Using Pseudo-classes (`:nth-child`)

**JavaScript DOM Manipulation:**
*   Selecting elements (`getElementById`, `querySelector`, `querySelectorAll`)
*   Modifying text content (`.textContent`)
*   Modifying styles (`.style` property)
*   Managing classes (`.classList.add()`)
*   Creating and appending elements (`createElement`, `.append()`)
*   Adding interactivity with `addEventListener`

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

*   **HTML5**
*   **CSS3** (Custom Properties, Flexbox)
*   **JavaScript (ES6+)**
    *   The entire interactive challenge is powered by a single, self-contained vanilla JavaScript engine.
    *   No external libraries or frameworks are used.

### üöÄ How to Run
